## Solution Explained
In FlexSim, I installed the gantt chart's components. (see Advanced tab in the chart properties). This will make the Statistics Collector for the chart available in the toolbox.

In the Columns tab of the collector, I altered the code for the State column, so that if the state changes to processing, a custom value is assigned to the column rather than the actual state name.

The actual state of the processor will stay as just "processing". There are also ways to change that, but if the differentiation should only appear in the state gantt, then I think this is the more elegant approach.
